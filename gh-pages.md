### Rails can be difficult for beginners

* Rails is getting more complicated
* as mentors, we can help

--

### Resistance

* when we're tired and discouraged
* attaches to imaginary problems
* attaches to real problems

--

### Overcoming resistance

* acknowledge real problems
* scale down the magnitude of the problem
* provide resources and problem-solving approaches

--

### 1. It is difficult to install Ruby.

* the beginner's first big obstacle
* not like installing a consumer app
* every system is unique

--

### Recommended

* use RVM
* article on [installing Rails](http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html)
* use [Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io/) when all else fails

--

### 2. Rails is a nightmare on Windows.

* open source devs use Unix-based tooling
* some gems won't work on Windows

--

### Recommended

* use [Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io/)
* install the [Railsbridge Virtual Machine](https://github.com/railsbridge-boston/railsbridge-virtual-machine)
* or [rails-dev-box](https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box)

--

### 3. Rails error reporting is cryptic.

* stack traces are intimidating
* error messages are "too technical"
* why can't it be simpler?

--

### Rails error reporting is actually very good.

* provides all the details an experienced developer needs
* can't say what you did wrong, only what happened when you did it
* help beginners read stack traces

--

### 4. There is too much magic.

* “convention over configuration” leads to obscurity
* implementation is hidden in the depths of the Rails

--

### The magic is there to serve you.

* do you like to know how things work?
* dig into the source code, or...
* take on faith that “it just works”

--

### 5. Rails contains lots of things I don’t understand.

* so many files and folders
* code that is unfamiliar
* what parts do I need to know?

--

### You'll gain understanding over time.

* you don't need to know all of Rails
* experienced developers are always learning

--

### 6. There is too much to learn.

* web development used to be simpler
* how do you keep up?

--

### There is joy in learning.

* lots of great resources we didn't have before
* your career will never be dull
* you can specialize

--

### 7. It is difficult to find up-to-date advice.

* new major releases of Rails every 2 years
* Google or Stack Overflow advice can be out-of-date

--

### Show beginners how to evaluate advice.

* filter the results in Google
* check the dates in Stack Overflow

--

### 8. It is difficult to know what gems to use.

* how do you find gems?
* which are best?

--

### Gem discovery is an art.

* use [The Ruby Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/)
* look at example applications
* monitor [Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/) and [RubyFlow](http://www.rubyflow.com/)

--

### 9. How to transition from tutorials to my own applications?

* copy and pasting gets me started, but...
* how do I build from scratch?

--

### Focus on the process.

* start with user stories
* look for code samples
* try "spikes"

--

### 10. I’m not sure where the code goes.

* does it go in the model or the controller?
* should all my controller actions be RESTful?

--

### Get peer support.

* read the blogs
* study examples
* go to hack nights

--

### 11. People like me don’t go into programming.

* not every programmer looks like one
* not everyone has the same background
* being different can be challenging

--

### We can be more welcoming.

* as engineers, we can optimize for inclusion
* get a clue, we all have biases
* get involved with [Railsbridge](http://railsbridge.org/) or [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com/)
